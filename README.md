# RockPaperScissorsJS
First time trying to create a game using JavaScript

The purpose of this project is to gain further knowledge of using JavaScript. This project was an assignment designed by TheOdinProject (TOP). The first iteration of this project has no graphical user interface, and uses the browswer's console. Feel free to use, fork, and/or leave critiques via comments or direct messages.
